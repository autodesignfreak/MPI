Very often it is necessary to compute an orthogonal, normalized basis for a subspace spanned by the N−dimensional vectors \vec{x_{0}}, . . . , \vec{x_{m−1}}. For simplicity we assume that this subspace is m dimensional. The standard method to construct the basis ⃗b0, . . . ,⃗ bm−1is the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, which proceeds as follows
